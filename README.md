Hi there 👋 I'm **Mehdi**, a front-end engineer with 9+ years of experience in agile software development who loves ❤️ writing clean code ✨ and building high-performance ⚡️ applications. 
I'm currently living in the beautiful city Antalya, Turkey 🇹🇷 working as the lead front-end engineer at SAN TSG / Octopus 🐙

Now... I would like to add some icons to make my profile a bit more eye-catching 😁
